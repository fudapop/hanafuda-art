## How to Play

### Overview
Koi-Koi is a simple card game that is typically played with hanafuda (literally "flower cards"). In this web-based version, the game is played with a standard 48-card deck. The objective of the game is to score points by collecting sets of cards, called "yaku". Points are awarded based on the number of yaku collected, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

### Gameplay
To play, simply click on the "Play now" button on the homepage. You will be dealt a hand of cards, and the AI opponent will be dealt a hand as well. To collect sets of cards, you must match cards in your hand with cards on the table that share the same suit (flower). Once you have collected a yaku, you will be prompted to continue (and possibly collect more yaku) or end the round and score points.

The game ends when all cards have been played, or when one player reaches a predetermined number of points.
