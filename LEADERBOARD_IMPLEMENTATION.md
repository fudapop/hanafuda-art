# Leaderboard Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive leaderboard system for the New Hanafuda game that displays player rankings based on their win/loss records stored in Firestore.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Leaderboard Page (`pages/leaderboard.vue`)
- **Route**: `/leaderboard`
- **Purpose**: Displays a ranked list of all players based on their game performance
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

### 2. Key Features

#### Data Source
- Fetches user data from Firestore's `users` collection
- Filters out users who haven't played any games (total games = 0)
- Includes both authenticated users and guest users

#### Ranking System
Multiple ranking options available via filter buttons:

1. **Overall** (Default)
   - Prioritizes win rate for players with 5+ games
   - Falls back to total wins for players with fewer games
   - This creates a balanced ranking that rewards both skill and activity

2. **Most Active**
   - Ranks by total games played
   - Only shows players with 5+ games to focus on active users

3. **Best Win Rate**
   - Ranks by win percentage
   - Only shows players with 10+ games for statistical significance

4. **Most Wins**
   - Simple ranking by total number of wins

5. **Richest**
   - Ranks by total coins accumulated

#### Display Features
- **Desktop View**: Full table with all statistics
- **Mobile View**: Card-based layout optimized for smaller screens
- **Medals**: Top 3 players get gold ðŸ¥‡, silver ðŸ¥ˆ, and bronze ðŸ¥‰ medals
- **Win Rate Badges**: Color-coded badges (green for 70%+, yellow for 50-69%, red for <50%)
- **Avatar Display**: Shows each player's chosen avatar with fallback handling
- **Guest Indicators**: Special labeling for guest players

#### User Statistics Shown
- Rank position
- Player username and avatar
- Total games played
- Wins, losses, and draws
- Win rate percentage
- Total coins

### 3. Navigation Integration

#### Start Screen Button
- Added a prominent "LEADERBOARD" button to the main start screen
- Accessible to all users (both logged in and guests)

#### Footer Links
- Added leaderboard links to both:
  - `StartScreenFooter.vue` - Main game footer
  - `ContentCard.vue` - Used in static pages

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Data Flow
1. Component fetches all users from Firestore on mount
2. Filters users who have played games (totalGames > 0)
3. Calculates win rates and other derived statistics
4. Applies selected filter/sorting
5. Renders responsive UI

#### Error Handling
- Loading states with sakura loader animation
- Error states with retry functionality
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Image error handling for avatars

#### Performance Considerations
- Fetches data once on page load
- Client-side filtering and sorting for instant responsiveness
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

### 5. User Experience

#### Accessibility
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Screen reader friendly labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Appropriate color contrast

#### Visual Design
- Consistent with game's existing design system
- Uses game's color palette and styling
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes

## How It Works

### Win/Loss Data Source
The leaderboard reads from user profiles stored in Firestore under the `users` collection. Each user profile contains:

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  uid: string
  username: string
  avatar: string
  record: {
    win: number
    loss: number
    draw: number
    coins: number
  }
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Data Updates
- User records are automatically updated when games end (existing functionality)
- Leaderboard reflects changes after page refresh
- No real-time updates implemented (could be added with Firestore listeners)

## Usage

1. **Accessing the Leaderboard**:
   - Click the "LEADERBOARD" button on the start screen
   - Or use the footer link from any page
   - Direct navigation to `/leaderboard`

2. **Viewing Rankings**:
   - Default view shows overall rankings
   - Use filter buttons to switch between different ranking criteria
   - Scroll through the list to see all players

3. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Automatically switches to card layout on smaller screens
   - All essential information remains visible
   - Touch-friendly interface

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Real-time Updates**: Use Firestore listeners for live leaderboard updates
2. **Pagination**: For large numbers of players
3. **Search/Filter**: Find specific players
4. **Time-based Rankings**: Weekly/monthly leaderboards
5. **Additional Statistics**: More detailed game statistics
6. **Social Features**: Following players, challenges, etc.

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `pages/leaderboard.vue` - Main leaderboard page

### Modified Files
- `components/NewStartScreen.vue` - Added leaderboard button
- `components/StartScreenFooter.vue` - Added leaderboard link
- `components/ContentCard.vue` - Added leaderboard link

## Testing

The implementation is ready for testing:
1. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to the game
3. Click the "LEADERBOARD" button or go to `/leaderboard`
4. Test different filter options
5. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

The leaderboard will show actual data from any existing users in the Firestore database who have played games.
