### 🎵 Dynamic Soundtrack

Get ready for a more immersive Hanafuda experience! We've introduced **adaptive background music** that intelligently responds to what's happening in the game.

### 🌊 How It Works
- **Menu Music**: Enjoy the serene, calming track `Awayuki` while browsing menus and selecting options
- **Gameplay Music**: Experience the exciting, epic theme `Epic Battle` when matches begin
- **Smooth Transitions**: The music crossfades seamlessly as you move between different areas of the game

### 🎛️ Your Control
- **Volume Controls**: Adjust the music volume to your preference in the settings
- **Mute Option**: Turn off audio completely if you prefer to play in silence  
- **Persistent Settings**: Your audio preferences are saved and remembered

The dynamic music system creates a more engaging atmosphere that enhances both the peaceful moments of strategy and the excitement of intense gameplay! 🎴
