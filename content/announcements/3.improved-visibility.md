### 🎴 Better Card Visibility
We've improved the card experience with **adjustable card sizes** that you can customize in the settings menu. Choose from three different sizes to find what works best for your device and playing style!

The cards are now more prominent during gameplay, making it easier to see details and select the cards you want.

### 🔍 Improved Collection Viewing
- **Double-click or double-tap** the collection area to open an expanded view of your cards
- **Larger card display** in the expanded collection view for better visibility
- **Enhanced organization** to help you see your progress at a glance

These visual and interaction improvements make the game more accessible and enjoyable to play across all devices!
