### ✨ A Touch of Polish

We've been busy tidying up the game to make your experience smoother and more visually pleasing. In response to great feedback from players like you, we've introduced a **more streamlined layout**, making it easier to focus on what matters most—the game!

### 🤔 To Koi-Koi, or Not to Koi-Koi?

Ever been on the verge of a big win, but hesitated on calling "koi-koi" because you couldn't remember if you had a valid yaku? We've got you covered!

Now, you can **open the yaku list directly from the call decision screen**! This little game-changer lets you review your potential winning hands right when you need it most, helping you make smarter, more confident decisions.

### 📱 Pro Tip: Go Fullscreen!

For the most immersive experience—especially on mobile—don't forget to use the fullscreen option in the system menu ⚙️. It makes a world of difference!

We hope these updates make your Hanafuda sessions even more enjoyable. Happy playing! 🎴
