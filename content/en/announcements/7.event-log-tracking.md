### 📋 Complete Game Action Visibility

We've introduced a powerful new **event log panel** that addresses a common need during intense matches—keeping track of every action that occurs in your game. This comprehensive logging system captures card draws, successful matches, and yaku completions with precise timestamps and visual card representations.

The event log ensures you never lose track of the game flow, making it easier to focus on strategy while maintaining full awareness of what has transpired during your match.

### 🎛️ Flexible Customization Options

The event log panel offers complete customization to suit your playing preferences. Resize it to your ideal dimensions, collapse it when you need more screen space, or hide it entirely for a minimalist experience. All settings are automatically preserved between sessions, ensuring your preferred configuration is always ready.

Whether you're developing your strategic understanding or reviewing critical game moments, the event log provides valuable insights to enhance your Hanafuda experience. We hope this addition proves helpful in your journey to master Koi-Koi! 🌸
