### ☁️ Cloud Game Saves

Never lose your progress again! We've implemented **cloud synchronization** for single-player game saves. If you're signed in, your saved games automatically sync across all your devices.

**What this means:**
- Start a game on your phone, continue on your computer
- Your progress is automatically backed up to the cloud
- Resume your game on any device where you're signed in
- No more worrying about losing your saved games

Perfect for players who switch between devices or want peace of mind knowing their progress is safe! 🎮

### ⚡ Performance Improvements

We've also made the game faster and more efficient, especially on mobile devices:

**Responsive Images:**
- Images now automatically load in the right size for your device
- Significantly reduced data usage on mobile
- Faster page loads without sacrificing visual quality
- Better experience on slower connections

**UI Polish:**
- Refined menu animations and styling
- Improved spacing and visual consistency
- Smoother interactions throughout the game

### 🎯 Better Reliability

Behind the scenes, we've fixed several issues that ensure your game settings and preferences load correctly from the start, and improved how the game handles different game configurations.

Your Hanafuda experience just got better! 🌸
