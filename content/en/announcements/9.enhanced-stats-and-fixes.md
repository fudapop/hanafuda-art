### 📊 Interactive Statistics Dashboard

**What's new:**

- Improved labeling and organization across all stat categories
- Clearer presentation of Cards Captured, Yaku Completed, Koi-Koi Calls, Rounds Played, and Games Played

Perfect for understanding your playing patterns and celebrating your achievements! 📈

### 🎯 Detailed Stat Breakdowns

Want to dive deeper into your performance? Every stat card is now interactive. Simply click any card to open a detailed modal showing the complete breakdown of that statistic. See exactly which cards you capture most, which yaku you complete regularly, and how your matches play out over time.

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

We've addressed two important issues to ensure your data accuracy and security:

**Game Records:** Fixed a bug where completing a game would incorrectly record both a win and a loss, causing inflated statistics. Your game records will now update correctly with accurate results.

**Save Security:** Enhanced the save game system with encrypted card data to prevent plain text visibility. This protects your saved games from potential manipulation while maintaining the same seamless save/resume experience.

Your stats are now more accurate, more visual, and more secure than ever. Time to rack up those wins! 🌸
