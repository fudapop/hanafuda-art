# Hanafuda Koi-Koi v2.3.3

*Released August 16, 2025*

This update brings significant improvements to the audio system with separate controls for background music and sound effects.

## Audio System Improvements

- **Audio System Refinement**: Introduced separate volume and disable controls for Background Music (BGM) and Sound Effects (SFX).
- **Resource Optimization**: Replaced mute functionality with a "disable" option for audio tracks, preventing them from playing in the background when off.
- **Improved Audio Resume**: Fixed an issue where background music would not resume after being re-enabled from a disabled state.
